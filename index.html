<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
<p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 03 June 2025</p>

<p>
  Thank you for installing <strong>Stop Alert</strong> (“<strong>the App</strong>”), published by
  <strong>Justcode Software Development PVT LTD</strong> (“<strong>Company</strong>,” “<strong>we</strong>,” “<strong>us</strong>,” “<strong>our</strong>”).
  We respect your privacy and are committed to protecting the personal data you share with us.
  This Privacy Policy describes how we collect, use, share, and safeguard information when you use the App and explains the choices you have.
  By using the App you agree to the practices described below.
</p>

<h2>1. Interpretation & Definitions</h2>
<h3>Interpretation</h3>
<p>
  Capitalised terms have the meanings set out in this section.
  They apply equally whether singular or plural.
</p>

<h3>Definitions</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Application / Service</strong>: the Stop Alert Android mobile application.</li>
  <li><strong>Company</strong>: Justcode Software Development PVT LTD.</li>
  <li><strong>Device</strong>: any mobile device that can run the Application.</li>
  <li><strong>Personal Data</strong>: information that identifies or can reasonably be linked to an individual.</li>
  <li><strong>Usage Data</strong>: information collected automatically from the Application (e.g. diagnostics, analytics).</li>
  <li><strong>Service Provider</strong>: any third‑party that processes data on behalf of the Company.</li>
  <li><strong>You / User</strong>: the individual using the Service.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>To provide and improve the App's core functionality, which is to alert you when you approach a pre-set destination, we collect the following types of information:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Precise Location Data (GPS):</strong> The App requires access to your device's precise location (latitude and longitude) to determine your current position and proximity to your set destination. This location data is used to trigger the geofence alarm. Location access is required both when the app is in use (foreground) and, if you enable it for continuous monitoring, when the app is in the background or your phone is locked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Destination Data:</strong> We store the destination(s) you set within the App on your local device. This information is necessary for the App to function and provide alerts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Device Information (Potentially):</strong> We may collect non-personally identifiable information about your device, such as device model, operating system version, and unique device identifiers for troubleshooting, analytics to improve app performance, and to ensure compatibility. This data is typically aggregated and anonymized.
            </li>
			
            <li>
                <strong>Background Location Disclosure (Google Play requirement):</strong>  Stop Alert continuously monitors your location in the background <em>only</em> to deliver destination alarms.
  The data is never used for advertising or shared for unrelated purposes, and monitoring stops immediately after your alarm triggers or is cancelled.
  Battery‑optimised APIs are used to minimise power consumption.
            </li>
		
        </ul>
        <div class="highlight">
            <p><strong>Important Note on Background Location:</strong> The core functionality of Stop Alert (providing timely alarms as you approach your destination, even if you are not actively using the app or your phone is locked) requires background location access. You will be prompted to grant this permission. If you do not grant background location permission, the alarm feature may not work reliably when the app is not in the foreground.</p>
        </div>

 <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information we collect for the following purposes:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>To Provide and Maintain the Service:</strong> Primarily, to monitor your location relative to your set destination and trigger an alarm and full-screen notification when you enter the defined alert radius (geofence).
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Improve the App:</strong> We may use aggregated and anonymized data to understand how users interact with the App, identify areas for improvement, and enhance user experience.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Ensure Functionality:</strong> To ensure the app operates correctly, including background operation for timely alerts.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>To Communicate With You (Rarely):</strong> We may use your information to respond to your inquiries or support requests if you contact us.
            </li>
        </ul>

<h2>4. Legal Bases (GDPR & equivalent)</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Consent</strong>: precise/background location access is requested through the Android runtime permission dialog.</li>
  <li><strong>Legitimate Interest</strong>: operating, maintaining, and securing the Service.</li>
  <li><strong>Legal Obligation</strong>: responding to lawful requests.</li>
</ul>
<h2>5. Advertising and AdMob</h2>
<p>
  The App uses Google AdMob to display mobile advertisements. AdMob may collect and use information about your device,
  including your advertising ID, to serve personalized ads and improve ad performance.
</p>
<p>
  This may include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Device information (such as make, model, operating system)</li>
  <li>Usage information (such as ad impressions, interactions)</li>
  <li>Advertising ID and other identifiers</li>
</ul>
<p>
  For more details on how Google uses this data, please visit:
  <a href="https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads" target="_blank">https://policies.google.com/technologies/ads</a>.
</p>
<p>
  You can opt out of personalized ads by adjusting your device settings:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Android:</strong> Settings &gt; Google &gt; Ads &gt; Opt out of Ads Personalization</li>
</ul>
<h2>6. Sharing & Disclosure</h2>
<p>
  We <strong>do not sell</strong> your Personal Data.
  Data is disclosed only:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>To Service Providers acting on our behalf under confidentiality agreements (e.g., crash analytics).</li>
  <li>In a merger, acquisition, or asset sale (with prior notice).</li>
  <li>When required by law or to protect our rights.</li>
  <li>With your explicit consent.</li>
</ul>

<h2>7. Retention</h2>
<p>
  Location data is transient: it resides in memory while the alarm is active and is discarded once the geofence is cleared.
  Diagnostic logs are retained for a maximum of 90 days unless an extended period is legally required.
</p>

<h2>8. Security</h2>
<p>
  We implement reasonable technical and organisational measures such as encrypted network connections (TLS) and secure Google Play infrastructure.
  Nevertheless, no system is 100 % secure and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
</p>

<h2>9. Your Privacy Rights</h2>
<p>
  Depending on your jurisdiction you may have rights to access, correct, erase, restrict, or object to the processing of your Personal Data.
  To exercise these rights, e‑mail us at <a href="mailto:contact.stopalert@gmail.com">contact.stopalert@gmail.com</a>.
</p>

<h2>10. Data Deletion Options</h2>
<p>
  You may delete individual alarms within the App, which removes the associated geofence data.
  To delete Usage Data or support correspondence please contact us; we honour verified requests within 30 days unless restricted by law.
</p>

<h2>11. Children’s Privacy</h2>
<p>
  The Service is not directed to children under 13.
  We do not knowingly collect Personal Data from children.
  If you believe a child has provided us data, contact us so we can delete it.
</p>

<h2>12. International Transfers</h2>
<p>
  We are based in India.
  Usage Data may be processed on servers located in other countries that may have different data‑protection laws.
  We ensure appropriate safeguards are in place for any cross‑border transfer.
</p>

<h2>13. Links to Third‑Party Sites</h2>
<p>
  The App may contain links to external sites (e.g., map providers). We are not responsible for their content or privacy practices.
  We encourage you to review their privacy policies.
</p>

<h2>14. Changes to This Policy</h2>
<p>
  We may update this Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted in‑app and on our website with a revised “Last updated” date.
  Material changes may be announced via an in‑app banner or push notification.
